<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Toronto Data Workshop brings together academia and industry to share data science and AI best practice. We are broadly interested, but especially in the code- and data-centric aspects of a project that are often glossed over. We meet weekly for an hour and most talks are recorded.</p>
<p>If you would like to attend, please sign up <a href="https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8">here</a>. Everyone is welcome—it is free and you do not need to be affiliated with the university.</p>
<p>The current organizing committee is: <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/">Kelly Lyons</a>, <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/michaela-drouillard-b29172164">Michaela Drouillard</a>, and Rohan Alexander. Past committee members: Amy Farrow (2021-22), Lorena Almaraz De La Garza (2021-22), and Faria Khandaker (2020-21).</p>

<li>“Evaluating the persuasive influence of political microtargeting with large language models”</li>
<li>Advances in LLMs have raised concerns over scalable, personalized political persuasion. In this talk, based on a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403116121">paper recently published in PNAS</a>, we integrate user data into GPT-4 prompts in real-time, facilitating the live creation of messages tailored to persuade individual users on political issues. We then deploy this application at scale to test whether personalized, microtargeted messaging offers a persuasive advantage compared to nontargeted messaging. We find that while messages generated by GPT-4 were persuasive, in aggregate, the persuasive impact of microtargeted messages was not statistically different from that of nontargeted messages. These findings suggest—contrary to widespread speculation—that the influence of current LLMs may reside not in their ability to tailor messages to individuals but rather in the persuasiveness of their generic, nontargeted messages.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kobihackenburg.com">Kobi Hackenburg</a> is a PhD candidate in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. His doctoral research, funded by a Clarendon Scholarship and supervised by Helen Margetts and Scott Hale, investigates the persuasive influence of personalized AI systems. More broadly, his work lies at the intersection of computation, language, and society. Alongside his PhD, he works as a Doctoral Researcher in the Public Policy Programme at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for AI and data science.</li>

<li><strong>Terry Yue Zhuo</strong>, Monash University</li>
<li>“BigCodeBench: Benchmarking Code Generation with Diverse Function Calls and Complex Instructions”</li>
<li>In this talk we introduce <a href="https://bigcode-bench.github.io/">BigCodeBench</a>, a benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained programming tasks. Our evaluation of 60 LLMs shows that LLMs are not yet capable of following complex instructions to use function calls precisely, with scores up to 60%, significantly lower than the human performance of 97%.</li>
<li><a href="https://terryyz.github.io">Terry Yue Zhuo</a> is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Monash University and the CSIRO’s Data61. He holds a Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) from Monash University.

<li><strong>Naman Jain</strong>, UC Berkeley</li>
<li>“LiveCodeBench: Holistic and contamination free evaluation of large language models for code”</li>
<li>In this talk we introduce <a href="https://livecodebench.github.io">LiveCodeBench</a>, a comprehensive and contamination-free benchmark for LLMs in code, which continuously collects new problems from LeetCode, AtCoder, and CodeForces. LiveCodeBench evaluates a wide range of capabilities, including self-repair, code execution, and test output prediction. It currently hosts 400 coding problems published between May 2023 and May 2024. We evaluated 18 base LLMs and 34 instruction-tuned LLMs, presenting findings on contamination, performance comparisons, and potential overfitting.</li>
<li><a href="https://naman-ntc.github.io">Naman Jain</a> is a CS Ph.D.&nbsp;student at UC Berkeley, focusing on using machine learning to enhance developer productivity tools like program analysis, synthesis, and repair. He also explores how synthesis and verification can improve algorithm generalizability and explainability. He holds an undergraduate degree from IIT Bombay, where he researched NLP robustness and computer vision. Before his Ph.D., he was a predoctoral research fellow at Microsoft Research India, working on program repair, improving large language models, and learning decision trees.</li>

<li>“THE PRISM Alignment Project”</li>
<li>The PRISM Alignment Project collects disaggregated feedback from a diverse collection of 1,500 participants from 75 countries based on how they converse with over 20 LLMs in real-time. This addresses the concern that human feedback learning in AI systems was collected from a narrow and unrepresentative set of crowdworkers. Details are available in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16019">pre-print</a> or the <a href="https://hannahkirk.github.io/prism-alignment/">project page</a>.</li>

<li>How can generative artificial intelligence (GAI) be used for sociological research? This talk explores applications to the study of text and images across multiple domains, including computational, qualitative, and experimental research. Drawing upon recent research and stylized experiments with DALL-E and GPT-4, discuss the potential applications of text-to-text, image-to-text, and text-to-image models for sociological research. Across these areas, GAI can make advanced computational methods more efficient, flexible, and accessible. The paper also emphasizes several challenges raised by these technologies, including interpretability, transparency, reliability, reproducibility, ethics, and privacy, as well as the implications of bias and bias mitigation efforts and the trade-offs between proprietary models and open-source alternatives. When used with care, these technologies can help advance many different areas of sociological methodology, complementing and enhancing our existing toolkits.

<li>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oN-FG6XfDUk">Using LLMs to code open-text social survey responses at scale</a>”</li>
<li>We compare the accuracy of six LLMs using a few-shot approach, three supervised learning algorithms (SVM, DistilRoBERTa, and a neural network trained on BERT embeddings), and a second human coder on the task of categorizing “most important issue” responses from the British Election Study Internet Panel into 50 categories. For the scenario where a researcher lacks existing training data, the accuracy of the highest-performing LLM (Claude-1.3: 93.9%) neared human performance (94.7%) and exceeded the highest-performing supervised approach trained on 1000 randomly sampled cases (neural network: 93.5%). In a scenario where previous data has been labeled but a researcher wants to label novel text, the best LLM’s (Claude-1.3: 80.9%) few-shot performance is only slightly behind the human (88.6%) and exceeds the best supervised model trained on 576,000 cases (DistilRoBERTa: 77.8%). PaLM-2, Llama-2, and the SVM all performed substantially worse than the best LLMs and supervised models across all metrics and scenarios. Our results suggest that LLMs may allow for greater use of open-ended survey questions in the future. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20531680241231468">Open access paper</a> published in <em>Research &amp; Politics</em> by Jonathan Mellon, Jack Bailey, Ralph Scott, James Breckwoldt, Marta Miori, Phillip Schmedeman and <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/8H0WTT">replication code/data</a> (includes all prompts/API calls/local models etc).</li>

<li>“Resolving Code Review Comments with Machine Learning”</li>
<li>Code reviews are a critical part of the software development process, taking a significant amount of the code authors’ and the code reviewers’ time. As part of this process, the reviewer inspects the proposed code and asks the author for code changes through comments written in natural language. With machine learning, we have an opportunity to automate and streamline the code-review process, e.g., by proposing code changes based on a comment’s text.</li>

<li>In the past decade, governments, non-profits, and other civic institutions have increasingly been sharing data on a wide range of topics, supporting various sectors of society from private enterprise to academic research. However, using this data in a programmatic and reproducible fashion is hampered by the myriad nature of the APIs provided to access it. In this talk, we explore one potential alternative to the predominant REST paradigm: storing tabular data in the open Parquet file format on publicly accessible endpoints. By using this standardized file format and a simple backing infrastructure, new tools based on Apache Arrow, such as DuckDB and Polars, can be used to build reusable front ends and other cost-effective solutions. We present a case study based on Statistics Canada’s library of public data sets, showcasing how such a system can simplify initial selection and filtering through common SQL queries.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/">Shiro</a> is a Ph.D.&nbsp;Candidate at the Department of Government, Harvard University. His research focuses on democratic representation in American Politics, for instance cast vote records, public opinion, survey methods, and applied statistics more generally. Shiro will bring together best practices for organizing data and code in the social sciences that experts have proposed with some of his own experience. He will propose a project-oriented workflow that adopts a minimal and consistent file organization structure within a single project, using RStudio Projects and GitHub. He will then discuss how to organize multiple projects that share common components, and propose the use of custom R packages to share code and Dataverse to share large datasets. He will use some of his own projects involving the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), one of the largest political surveys of American Politics, as a demonstration.</li>
