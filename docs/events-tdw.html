<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Toronto Data Workshop (TDW) brings together academia and industry to share data science best practice. We are broadly interested, but especially in the data-centric aspects of a data science project. We meet weekly for an hour, typically Fridays at noon (Toronto time), hybrid (in-person at the Faculty of Information and online via Zoom), with most talks recorded and shared. For an invitation please sign up <a href="https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8">here</a>. Anyone is welcome to attend—it is free and you don’t need to be affiliated with the university.</p>

Originally from Melbourne, Australia, Brittany received her B.A. in International Studies from the University of Saskatchewan and started her career in economic development, equipping her with comprehensive knowledge of foreign direct investment and international business early in her career. She went on to obtain an M.A.&nbsp;in European and Russian Affairs from the University of Toronto in 2018, where she first discovered the potential of programming for political science and became fascinated with artificial intelligence (AI). Over the past three years, Brittany has worked in many facets of the AI industry, from leading research and development of new AI products for video game developers to building automated data pipelines for business intelligence and managing software engineering and client engagement teams. In that time, she has honed technical skills in full-stack development, machine learning, and data engineering. She recently struck out on her own to launch an online global event monitoring tool and deliver novel solutions to clients in the political risk and social enterprise sectors. Brittany is a firm believer in the potential for data-driven technologies for geopolitics and is excited to contribute to the many discoveries to be made in this space.</li>
