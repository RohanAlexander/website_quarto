<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>We share best practice for data science, and are especially interested in the data munging/cleaning/prep/comms stages that folks typically don’t talk about. We meet for an hour each week and are interested in anything that is data-focused across academia and industry. Typically, Fridays at noon (Toronto time) via Zoom, with most talks recorded and shared. All welcome. Free. Sign up <a href="https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Toronto Data Workshop (TDW) brings together academia and industry to consider, collate, share, and disseminate best practices in doing data science, especially in the data-centric steps of a data science project: collection; cleaning; storage; retrieval; dissemination; protection; and communication. We meet weekly for an hour and aim to have a roughly even split of participants from academia and industry over the course of each term. For an invitation please sign up <a href="https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8">here</a>. Anyone is welcome to attend - you don’t need to be affiliated with the university.</p>
<p>Current organizing committee:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/">Kelly Lyons</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/michaela-drouillard-b29172164">Michaela Drouillard</a>,</li>
<li>Rohan Alexander.</li>

<li>Faria Khandaker (2020-21)</li>
<li>Lorena Almaraz De La Garza (2021-22)</li>
</ul>
<p>The TDW is a joint initiative between the Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto and we especially thank Dean Wendy Duff and Chair Radu Craiu for their support.</p>

Originally from Melbourne, Australia, Brittany received her B.A. in International Studies from the University of Saskatchewan and started her career in economic development, equipping her with comprehensive knowledge of foreign direct investment and international business early in her career. She went on to obtain an M.A.&nbsp;in European and Russian Affairs from the University of Toronto in 2018, where she first discovered the potential of programming for political science and became fascinated with artificial intelligence (AI). Over the past three years, Brittany has worked in many facets of the AI industry, from leading research and development of new AI products for video game developers to building automated data pipelines for business intelligence and managing software engineering and client engagement teams. In that time, she has honed technical skills in full-stack development, machine learning, and data engineering. She recently struck out on her own to launch an online global event monitoring tool and deliver novel solutions to clients in the political risk and social enterprise sectors. Brittany is a firm believer in the potential for data-driven technologies for geopolitics and is excited to contribute to the many discoveries to be made in this space.</li>

Bio: <a href="https://weallcount.com">Heather</a> remains unconvinced. As a statistician with decades of global experience working on complex data problems and producing real-world knowledge, she has developed the Data Equity Framework to address the equity issues in data products and research projects. Her emphasis is on combining strong statistical analysis with clear and meaningful communication. She is currently working on implementing tools for equity and ethics in data. As the founder of two successful data science companies, she attacks the largest questions facing societies today, working with both civic and corporate organizations to improve outcomes and lives. Her relentless pursuit of clarity and realism in these projects pushed her beyond pure analysis to mastering the entire data ecosystem including award-winning work in data sourcing, modeling, and data storytelling, each incorporating bleeding edge theory and technologies. Heather is the founder of We All Count, a project for equity in data working with teams across the globe to embed a lens of ethics into their data products from funding to data collection to statistical analysis and algorithmic accountability. Her unique set of tools and contributions have been sought across a range of clients from MasterCard and Volkswagen to the United Nations, the Syrian Refugee Resettlement Secretariat, Airbnb, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. She is on the Data Advisory Board of the UNHCR.<br>
