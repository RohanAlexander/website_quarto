## Overview

The Toronto Data Workshop brings together academia and industry to share data science and AI best practice. We are broadly interested, but especially in the code- and data-centric aspects of a project that are often glossed over. We meet weekly for an hour and most talks are recorded.

If you would like to attend, please sign up here: [https://rohanalexander.substack.com](https://rohanalexander.substack.com)

  - **Hannah Rose Kirk**, Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford
  - "What does it mean for AI to be “aligned”?"
  - Alignment has become a buzzword that frequently surfaces throughout the AI ecosystem. But what does it mean to align LLMs to the hundreds of millions of people who now interact with their outputs, each with different preferences for language, conversational norms, value systems, and political beliefs? This talk will explore the gnarly concept of alignment, specifically for large language models (LLMs). Using insights from the recently released [PRISM Alignment Dataset](https://hannahkirk.github.io/prism-alignment/), we'll cover key questions around empirical alignment efforts, such as how to collect human feedback using various scales and signals, where to focus human labour, who to ask for feedback, and whether to target objectives of personalised or collective alignment. Through more comprehensive and representative data, PRISM highlights the challenges of aligning LLMs to meet the diverse expectations and beliefs of a global audience.
  - [Hannah Rose Kirk](https://www.hannahrosekirk.com) is a PhD student at the University of Oxford, UK.

	- **Kobi Hackenburg**, Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford
	- "[Evaluating the persuasive influence of political microtargeting with large language models](https://youtu.be/0RqC98xHiyk)"
	- Advances in LLMs have raised concerns over scalable, personalized political persuasion. In this talk, based on a [paper recently published in PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403116121), we integrate user data into GPT-4 prompts in real-time, facilitating the live creation of messages tailored to persuade individual users on political issues. We then deploy this application at scale to test whether personalized, microtargeted messaging offers a persuasive advantage compared to nontargeted messaging. We find that while messages generated by GPT-4 were persuasive, in aggregate, the persuasive impact of microtargeted messages was not statistically different from that of nontargeted messages. These findings suggest—contrary to widespread speculation—that the influence of current LLMs may reside not in their ability to tailor messages to individuals but rather in the persuasiveness of their generic, nontargeted messages.

	- **Tom Davidson**, Rutgers University
	- "[Start Generating: Harnessing Generative Artificial Intelligence for Sociological Research](https://youtu.be/feza5g3lAP4)"
	- How can generative artificial intelligence (GAI) be used for sociological research? This talk explores applications to the study of text and images across multiple domains, including computational, qualitative, and experimental research. Drawing upon recent research and stylized experiments with DALL-E and GPT-4, discuss the potential applications of text-to-text, image-to-text, and text-to-image models for sociological research. Across these areas, GAI can make advanced computational methods more efficient, flexible, and accessible. The paper also emphasizes several challenges raised by these technologies, including interpretability, transparency, reliability, reproducibility, ethics, and privacy, as well as the implications of bias and bias mitigation efforts and the trade-offs between proprietary models and open-source alternatives. When used with care, these technologies can help advance many different areas of sociological methodology, complementing and enhancing our existing toolkits.

	- **Jonathan Mellon**, West Point
	- "[Using LLMs to code open-text social survey responses at scale](https://youtu.be/oN-FG6XfDUk)"
	- We compare the accuracy of six LLMs using a few-shot approach, three supervised learning algorithms (SVM, DistilRoBERTa, and a neural network trained on BERT embeddings), and a second human coder on the task of categorizing "most important issue" responses from the British Election Study Internet Panel into 50 categories. For the scenario where a researcher lacks existing training data, the accuracy of the highest-performing LLM (Claude-1.3: 93.9%) neared human performance (94.7%) and exceeded the highest-performing supervised approach trained on 1000 randomly sampled cases (neural network: 93.5%). In a scenario where previous data has been labeled but a researcher wants to label novel text, the best LLM's (Claude-1.3: 80.9%) few-shot performance is only slightly behind the human (88.6%) and exceeds the best supervised model trained on 576,000 cases (DistilRoBERTa: 77.8%). PaLM-2, Llama-2, and the SVM all performed substantially worse than the best LLMs and supervised models across all metrics and scenarios. Our results suggest that LLMs may allow for greater use of open-ended survey questions in the future.

  - In the past decade, governments, non-profits, and other civic institutions have increasingly been sharing data on a wide range of topics, supporting various sectors of society from private enterprise to academic research. However, using this data in a programmatic and reproducible fashion is hampered by the myriad nature of the APIs provided to access it. In this talk, we explore one potential alternative to the predominant REST paradigm: storing tabular data in the open Parquet file format on publicly accessible endpoints. By using this standardized file format and a simple backing infrastructure, new tools based on Apache Arrow, such as DuckDB and Polars, can be used to build reusable front ends and other cost-effective solutions. We present a case study based on Statistics Canada’s library of public data sets, showcasing how such a system can simplify initial selection and filtering through common SQL queries.

    - [Shiro](https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/) is a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Government, Harvard University. His research focuses on democratic representation in American Politics, for instance cast vote records, public opinion, survey methods, and applied statistics more generally. Shiro will bring together best practices for organizing data and code in the social sciences that experts have proposed with some of his own experience. He will propose a project-oriented workflow that adopts a minimal and consistent file organization structure within a single project, using RStudio Projects and GitHub. He will then discuss how to organize multiple projects that share common components, and propose the use of custom R packages to share code and Dataverse to share large datasets. He will use some of his own projects involving the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), one of the largest political surveys of American Politics, as a demonstration.
