## Overview

The Toronto Data Workshop (TDW) brings together academia and industry to share data science best practice. We are broadly interested, but especially in the data-centric aspects of a data science project. We meet weekly for an hour, typically Fridays at noon (Toronto time), hybrid (in-person at the Faculty of Information and online via Zoom), with most talks recorded and shared. For an invitation please sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8). Anyone is welcome to attend---it is free and you don't need to be affiliated with the university.

Current organizing committee:

- [Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/), 
- [Michaela Drouillard](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/michaela-drouillard-b29172164),
- Rohan Alexander. 

Past committee members: 

- Amy Farrow (2021-22)
- Faria Khandaker (2020-21)
- Lorena Almaraz De La Garza (2021-22)

The TDW is a joint initiative between the Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto and we especially thank Wendy Duff and Radu Craiu for their support.
