I document and adjust for a systematic error in the 2017 data. The data show that homelessness in Toronto is a large problem; essentially all shelters are almost always full. COVID changed the nature of the problem by reducing the number of people using shelters, however they must be sleeping somewhere. I compare January 2021 with January 2020 and estimate that following COVID there are now around an additional 3,500 people sleeping somewhere outside of shelters, possibly outdoors.\nauthor:\n  - name: Rohan Alexander\n    url: {rohanalexander.com}\ndate: 2021-01-24\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n    toc: true\n    toc_depth: 3\ndraft: false\nbibliography: references.bib    \ncollections:\n  posts:\n    citations: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe extent of homelessness in Toronto was highlighted for the R community in December 2020 when the dataset was used in TidyTuesday. That dataset contained data for 2017 to 2019, inclusive. In this post I expand the dataset through to January 2021 to see what has happened since COVID. I also document and adjust for a systematic error in the 2017 dataset. I compare the usage of shelters this year with last year. I estimate that on Friday, 22 January 2021, when it was -11C with winds of 17km/h, there were roughly 3,634 additional people sleeping somewhere other than a shelter, compared with this time last year.\n\n## Set up workspace and gather data\n\nI'll use the R statistical programming language [@citeR]. The datasets are accessed via the `opendatatoronto` package [@sharla]. This package wraps around the [City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca) and allows the direct import of data rather than the need to visit the website. The website is great, but using the package enhances reproducibility. I'll use the `tidyverse` package to make data manipulation easier [@citetidyverse].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(opendatatoronto)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get the data\n# Based on https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-12-01/readme.md\nall_data <- \n  opendatatoronto::search_packages(\"Daily Shelter Occupancy\") %>% \n  opendatatoronto::list_package_resources() %>% \n  dplyr::filter(name %in% c(\"daily-shelter-occupancy-2017-csv\",\n                     \"daily-shelter-occupancy-2018-csv\", \n                     \"daily-shelter-occupancy-2019-csv\", \n                     \"daily-shelter-occupancy-2020.csv\")) %>% \n  group_split(name) %>% # Don't totally understand how this works\n  map_dfr(get_resource, .id = \"file\")\nwrite_csv(all_data, \"inputs/raw_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLet's just have a quick look at the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall_data <- read_csv(\"inputs/raw_data.csv\", \n                     col_types = c(\"iiccccccccccii\")) \n# The col_types hieroglyphics above stand for integer, integer, character... etc.\nhead(all_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 14\n   file `_id` OCCUPANCY_DATE  ORGANIZATION_NAME SHELTER_NAME\n  <int> <int> <chr>           <chr>             <chr>       \n1     1     1 2017-01-01T00:… COSTI Immigrant … COSTI Recep…\n2     1     2 2017-01-01T00:… Christie Ossingt… Christie Os…\n3     1     3 2017-01-01T00:… Christie Ossingt… Christie Os…\n4     1     4 2017-01-01T00:… Christie Refugee… Christie Re…\n5     1     5 2017-01-01T00:… City of Toronto   Birchmount …\n6     1     6 2017-01-01T00:… City of Toronto   Birkdale Re…\n# ℹ 9 more variables: SHELTER_ADDRESS <chr>,\n#   SHELTER_CITY <chr>, SHELTER_PROVINCE <chr>,\n#   SHELTER_POSTAL_CODE <chr>, FACILITY_NAME <chr>,\n#   PROGRAM_NAME <chr>, SECTOR <chr>, OCCUPANCY <int>,\n#   CAPACITY <int>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data cleaning and preparation\n\n### Make the data easier to deal with\n\nThe column names aren't overly nice to type, there are a few columns that we're not really going to use much, and finally a few of the columns have data that are less obvious than they should be.

Data.', so before moving on, I should plot the raw data to see if there's anything else going on. (Here, students seem to get confused what 'raw' means; I'm using it to refer to as close to the original dataset as possible, so no sums, or averages, etc, if possible. Not necessarily before any cleaning. Sometimes your data are too disperse for that so there will be an element of manipulation. The main point is that you, at the very least, need to plot the data that you're going to be modelling.)\n\nLet's just plot the order. As this dataset has been put together by a human we'd expect that it'd be in order of date. Let's just plot the date in the order it appears in the dataset (Figure \\@ref(fig:plotorder)).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoronto_shelters %>% \n  mutate(row_number = c(1:nrow(toronto_shelters))) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = row_number, y = date), alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Row number\",\n       y = \"Date\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of row number with date](toronto-shelter-usage_files/figure-html/plotorder-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n😱😱😱 This is a bit of a 'hacky' graph but it illustrates the point which is that the data are not in order in the dataset. If they were in order, then we'd expect them to be along the diagonal. \n\nIt's super weird  that they're not in order in the raw data. Above, I checked by splitting them into pieces (day, month, year) and the counts were okay. But the 'hacky' graph was pretty hacky, so let's try to summarise the data a little and then have another look. We'll get a count by date and the sector of the shelter.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Based on Lisa Lendway: \n# https://github.com/llendway/tidy_tuesday_in_thirty/blob/main/2020_12_01_tidy_tuesday.Rmd\ntoronto_shelters_by_day <- \n  toronto_shelters %>% \n  # We only want rows with both occupancy and capacity  \n  tidyr::drop_na(occupancy, capacity) %>% \n  # We want to know the occupancy by date and sector\n  group_by(date, sector) %>% \n  summarise(occupancy = sum(occupancy),\n            capacity = sum(capacity),\n            usage = occupancy / capacity, .groups = 'drop')\n\nhead(toronto_shelters_by_day)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  date       sector   occupancy capacity usage\n  <date>     <chr>        <int>    <int> <dbl>\n1 2017-01-01 Co-ed          530      582 0.911\n2 2017-01-01 Families      1030     1150 0.896\n3 2017-01-01 Men           1595     1706 0.935\n4 2017-01-01 Women          641      697 0.920\n5 2017-01-01 Youth          499      518 0.963\n6 2017-01-02 Co-ed          458      582 0.787\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe are interested in availability of shelter spots in Toronto on the basis of sector for each day.

Understandably the homeless, like all of us, want to socially distance to the extent possible and this likely means avoiding shelters. If you live in Toronto one thing that you'll notice is that there are a lot of homeless people living in parks since COVID started. While this was fine in summer, the issue is that in winter it is well below 0C overnight.\n\nWe might like to see if we can estimate how many additional people are sleeping outside in January. We'll do this by comparing the number that slept in the shelters in January 2021, compared with the number in the shelters in January 2020, which is before COVID hit Toronto. As Kieran Healy says, an exercise like this is confronting. \n\nWhile it's a stretch to say that if they're not sleeping in a shelter then they must be sleeping outside, it's also not clear where else they could be if they're not in a shelter. It's possible that they have found permanent housing and so are no longer using shelters, however I don't know of any substantial change in public policy or resource allocation such that the whole difference is due to people finding permanent homes.\n\nWe'll use the data that the city has so far released for 2021.

freezing conditions this year compared with last year. That is to say, shelter usage is that much below what it was, and I'm not sure where else they could go. In particular, on Friday night, when it was horrendously cold, I estimate there were 3,634 additional people likely sleeping outside, by comparing the usage of shelters on 22 January 2020 with 22 January 2021.\n\nEven if I'm off by an order of magnitude, the city and province clearly should do more.\n\n\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\n\nThank you to Monica Alexander for helpful comments.\n\n",
