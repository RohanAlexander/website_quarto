It uses a regression model to relate individual-level survey responses to various characteristics and then rebuilds the sample to better match the population. In this way MRP can not only allow a better understanding of responses, but also allow us to analyse data that may otherwise be unusable. However, it can be a challenge to get started with MRP as the terminology may be unfamiliar, and the data requirements can be onerous.\n\nThe purpose of this hands-on workshop is to de-mystify MRP and give participants the ability and confidence to: 1) critically read papers that use it; and 2) apply it in their own work. Examples of how to implement MRP will be illustrated in R using the brms package. No experience with R is required but workshop participants should bring a laptop that is: a) connected to the internet; b) has R and R Studio installed, along with the tidyverse and brms packages (if you have a hassle doing this then come early to the workshop and I can help you).\n\nThe GitHub repo that you should download is: https://github.com/RohanAlexander/mrp_workshop.\n\n# Schedule\n\n- 8:45 - 9:00: (Optional) Help with computer set-up.\n- 9:00 - 9:15: Introduction, motivation, and example.\n- 9:15 - 9:25: Live-coding introductory example.\n- 9:25 - 9:45: Participants pair-code introductory example.\n- 9:45 - 9:55: Live coding extended example.\n- 10:00 - 10:30: Participants pair-code extended example.\n- 10:30 - 10:50: Live example improving the workflow: gathering data from the ABS, improving the model, and communicating results.\n- 10:50 - 11:00: Concluding remarks about strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of application.\n\n\n# Help with computer set-up.\nThe primary programming language used for MRP tends to be R, but any similar language would be fine. That said, if you are already comfortable with another open source language, such as Python, then it wouldn't hurt to learn R as well. You are welcome to use whatever language you are most comfortable with, but it will be easiest for you to be able to draw on other examples if you use R. All of the examples in this workshop are in R.\n\n## Computing\nR can be downloaded for free from: http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/.\n\nRStudio is an interface that makes using R easier and it can be downloaded for free from: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.\n\nWe will use brms later in the tutorial. In order to use this your Mac needs to have Xcode and a bunch of other things installed. To do this go to:\nhttps://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools#how-do-i-use-the-installer and within the 'assets' bit of the project's release page, download 'macos-rtools-3.1.0.pkg' and then install that. It'll take a few minutes because it is downloading and setting up a bunch of things.\n\n\n\n## Getting help\nAt some point your code won't run or will throw an error. This is normal, and it happens to everyone. It happens to me on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. Getting frustrated is understandable. There are a few steps that are worthwhile taking when this happens:\n\n- If you are having issues with a particular function then the Help file for that function can be accessed by adding a ? to the front. e.g. '?lm'.\n-\tIf you're getting an error then try googling it, (I find it can help to include the term ‘R' and 'MRP' or ‘tidyverse' or the relevant package name). \n-\tIf your code just isn't running, then try searching for what you are trying to do, e.g. ‘save PDF of graph in R made using ggplot'. Almost always there are relevant blog posts or Stack Overflow answers that will help.\n-\tTry to restart R and R Studio and load everything again.\n-\tTry to restart your computer. \n\nThere are a few small mistakes that I often make and may be worth checking in case you make them too: \n\n-\tcheck the class e.g. class(my_dataset$its_column) to make sure that is what it should be; \n-\twhen you're using ggplot make sure you use ‘+' not ‘%>%'; \n-\tcheck whether you are using ‘.' when you shouldn't be, or vice versa.\n\nIt's almost always helpful to take a break and come back the next day.\n\n\n# Introduction, motivation, and example\nMulti-level regression with post-stratification (MRP) is a handy approach when dealing with survey data. Essentially, it trains a model based on the survey, and then applies that trained model to another dataset. There are two main, related, advantages:\n\n1) It can allow us to 're-weight' in a way that includes uncertainty front-of-mind and isn't hamstrung by small samples.\n2) It can allow us to use broad surveys to speak to subsets.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, it tends to be less expensive to collect non-probability samples and so there are benefits of being able to use these types of data. That said, it is not a magic-bullet and the laws of statistics still apply. We will have larger uncertainty around our estimates and they will still be subject to all the usual biases. As [Lauren Kennedy](https://twitter.com/jazzystats) points out, 'MRP has traditionally been used in probability surveys and had potential for non-probability surveys, but we're not sure of the limitations at the moment.' \n\nOne famous example is Wei Wang, David Rothschild, Sharad Goel, and Andrew Gelman, 2014, 'Forecasting elections with non-representative polls', *International Journal of Forecasting*. They used data from the Xbox gaming platform to forecast the 2012 US Presidential Election.\n\nKey facts about the set-up:\n\n- Data from an opt-in poll which was available on the Xbox gaming platform during the 45 days preceding the 2012 US presidential election.\n- Each day there were three to five questions, including voter intention: \"If the election were held today, who would you vote for?\"\n- Respondents were allowed to answer at most once per day.\n- First-time respondents were asked to provide information about themselves, including their sex, race, age, education, state, party ID, political ideology, and who they voted for in the 2008 presidential election. \n- In total, 750,148 interviews were conducted, with 345,858 unique respondents - over 30,000 of whom completed five or more polls\n- Young men dominate the Xbox population: 18-to-29-year-olds comprise 65 per cent of the Xbox dataset, compared to 19 per cent in the exit poll; and men make up 93 per cent of the Xbox sample but only 47 per cent of the electorate.\n\nGiven the US electorate, they use a two-stage modelling approach. The details don't really matter too much, and essentially they model how likely a respondent is to vote for Obama, given various information such as state, education, sex, etc:\n$$\nPr\\left(Y_i = \\mbox{Obama} | Y_i\\in\\{\\mbox{Obama, Romney}\\}\\right) = \\mbox{logit}^{-1}(\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1(\\mbox{state last vote share}) \n+ \\alpha_{j[i]}^{\\mbox{state}} + \\alpha_{j[i]}^{\\mbox{edu}} + \\alpha_{j[i]}^{\\mbox{sex}}...\n)\n$$\nThey run this in R using glmer() from lme4.\n\nHaving a trained model that considers the effect of these various independent variables on support for the candidates, they now post-stratify, where each of these \"cell-level estimates are weighted by the proportion of the electorate in each cell and aggregated to the appropriate level (i.e., state or national).\" \n\nThis means that they need cross-tabulated population data. In general, the census would have worked, or one of the other large surveys available in the US, but the difficulty is that the variables need to be available on a cross-tab basis. As such, they use exit polls (not an option for Australia in general).\n\nThey make state-specific estimates by post-stratifying to the features of each state.\n![State estimates from the Xbox paper.](inputs/figures/states.png)\n\nSimilarly, they can examine demographic-differences.\n![Demographic differences from the Xbox paper.](inputs/figures/demographics.png)\n\nFinally, they convert their estimates into electoral college estimates.\n![Electoral College estimates from the Xbox paper.](inputs/figures/electoral_college.png)\n\n\n\n# Live-coding introductory example\n\nThe workflow that we are going to use is: \n\n1) read in the poll;\n2) model the poll; \n3) read in the post-stratification data; and\n4) apply the model to the post-stratification data.\n\nFirst load the packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Uncomment these (by deleting the #) if you need to install the packages\n# install.packages(\"broom\")\n# install.packages(\"here\")\n# install.packages(\"skimr\")\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nlibrary(broom) # Helps make the regression results tidier\nlibrary(here) # Helps make file referencing easier.\nlibrary(skimr) # Helps summarise the data\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Helps make programming with R easier\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen load some sample polling data to analyse. I have generated this fictitious data so that we have some idea of what to expect from the model. The dependent variable is supports_ALP, which is a binary variable - either 0 or 1. We'll just use two independent variables here: gender, which is either Female or Male (as that is what is available from the ABS); and age_group, which is one of four groups: ages 18 to 29, ages 30 to 44, ages 45 to 59, ages 60 plus.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_poll <- read_csv(\"outputs/data/example_poll.csv\") # Here we read in a \n# CSV file and assign it to a dataset called 'example_poll'\n\nhead(example_poll) # Displays the first 10 rows\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  gender age_group  supports_ALP state\n  <chr>  <chr>             <dbl> <chr>\n1 Male   ages30to44            0 NSW  \n2 Female ages45to59            0 NSW  \n3 Female ages60plus            1 VIC  \n4 Male   ages30to44            1 QLD  \n5 Female ages30to44            1 QLD  \n6 Female ages18to29            1 VIC  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Look at some summary statistics to make sure the data seem reasonable\nsummary(example_poll) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    gender           age_group          supports_ALP       state          \n Length:5000        Length:5000        Min.   :0.0000   Length:5000       \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:0.0000   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :1.0000   Mode  :character  \n                                       Mean   :0.5514                     \n                                       3rd Qu.:1.0000                     \n                                       Max.   :1.0000                     \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nskimr::skim(example_poll)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Data summary\n\n|                         |             |\n|:------------------------|:------------|\n|Name                     |example_poll |\n|Number of rows           |5000         |\n|Number of columns        |4            |\n|_______________________  |             |\n|Column type frequency:   |             |\n|character                |3            |\n|numeric                  |1            |\n|________________________ |             |\n|Group variables          |None         |\n\n\n**Variable type: character**\n\n|skim_variable | n_missing| complete_rate| min| max| empty| n_unique| whitespace|\n|:-------------|---------:|-------------:|---:|---:|-----:|--------:|----------:|\n|gender        |         0|             1|   4|   6|     0|        2|          0|\n|age_group     |         0|             1|  10|  10|     0|        4|          0|\n|state         |         0|             1|   2|   3|     0|        8|          0|\n\n\n**Variable type: numeric**\n\n|skim_variable | n_missing| complete_rate| mean|  sd| p0| p25| p50| p75| p100|hist  |\n|:-------------|---------:|-------------:|----:|---:|--:|---:|---:|---:|----:|:-----|\n|supports_ALP  |         0|             1| 0.55| 0.5|  0|   0|   1|   1|    1|▆▁▁▁▇ |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI generated this polling data to make both made males and older people less likely to vote for the Australian Labor Party; and females and younger people more likely to vote for the Labor Party.

It does this by pooling, in which the effect of these young, male, Tasmanians is partially determined by other cells that do have respondents. \n\n\n\n## Gathering data\nGetting data tends to be the most troublesome aspect. I've found that the census is fairly useful although it can require some trade-offs (e.g. if you are doing political work then it's not exactly the same as the electoral roll even if you restrict it to Australian citizens aged at least 18). Nonetheless, I've found the best way to get the sub-cell counts is to use ABS TableBuilder. There are two versions - 'basic' which is free, and 'pro', which is normally $2,510 per year, but which you can get access to if you're associated with an Australian university. \n\n![TableBuilder front page.](inputs/figures/tablebuilder.png)\n\nOnce you create an account then you can access census data for 2006, 2011, and 2016. (The ABS have relatively recently done some linking between censuses so there is actually some linked data, which is exciting).\n\n![TableBuilder after logging in.](inputs/figures/census_select_type.png)\n\nThe website is a bit cumbersome, but considering what they provide it is worth sticking with it. I usually use 'Counting Persons, Place of Usual Residence', but sometimes 'Counting Persons, Place of Enumeration' is also handy.\n\n![TableBuilder selecting which census.](inputs/figures/census_type.png)\n\nWe want to create a new table, and we do this by specifying the columns and rows.\n\n![TableBuilder selecting columns.](inputs/figures/census_cols.png)\n\nOnce you have the set-up that you want then you can retrieve the data. \n\n![TableBuilder selecting rows.](inputs/figures/census_rows.png)\n\nYou can download the data in various Excel, CSV, and other formats. If your dataset is large then you may need to submit for it to be built, which can take a day or two. Finally, if your sub-cell counts are especially small, then they will be blown around by the randomness that the ABS adds.\n\n![TableBuilder downloading data and creating custom groups.](inputs/figures/census_download.png)\n\nHelpfully you can create custom groupings for geography, say to load specific electorates, and other aspects, such as age-groups. To get started with this, select 'Custom data'.\n\n\n## Communication\nThere are many interesting aspects that we may like to communicate to others. For instance, we may like to show how the model is affecting the results. We can make a graph that compares the raw estimate with the model estimate.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npost_stratified_estimates %>% \n  ggplot(aes(y = mean, x = forcats::fct_inorder(state), color = \"MRP estimate\")) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0) + \n  ylab(\"Proportion ALP support\") + \n  xlab(\"State\") + \n  geom_point(data = example_poll %>% \n               group_by(state, supports_ALP) %>%\n               summarise(n = n()) %>% \n               group_by(state) %>% \n               mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>% \n               filter(supports_ALP==1), \n             aes(state, prop, color = \"Raw data\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'state'.

If you have a good quality survey, then it may be a way to speak to disaggregated aspects of it. Or if you are concerned about uncertainty then it is a good way to think about that. If you have a biased survey then it's a great place to start, but it's not a panacea.\n\nThere's not a lot of work that's been done using Australian data, so there's plenty of scope for exciting work. I look forward to seeing what you do with it!\n\n\n\n# Next steps\n\nThere are a lot of resources out there that would make great next steps.
