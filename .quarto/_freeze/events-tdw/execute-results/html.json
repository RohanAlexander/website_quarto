However, using this data in a programmatic and reproducible fashion is hampered by the myriad nature of the APIs provided to access it. In this talk, we explore one potential alternative to the predominant REST paradigm: storing tabular data in the open Parquet file format on publicly accessible endpoints. By using this standardized file format and a simple backing infrastructure, new tools based on Apache Arrow, such as DuckDB and Polars, can be used to build reusable front ends and other cost-effective solutions. We present a case study based on Statistics Canada’s library of public data sets, showcasing how such a system can simplify initial selection and filtering through common SQL queries.\n\t- Chiara, Franklin, and Helena are second-year computer science students at the University of Waterloo who are interested in applying new software and data engineering tooling to increase the accessibility of public data sets.\n- Friday 24 November 2023, noon - 1pm\n\t- **Wendy Foster**, Shopify\t\n\t- *Socio-technical processes for data integrity*\t\n\t- Wendy Foster is Director of Engineering and Data, Optimize, at Shopify.\n- Friday 1 December 2023, noon - 1pm\n\t- **Thomas Davidson**, Rutgers University\t\n\t- *Start Generating: Harnessing Generative Artificial Intelligence for Sociological Research*\t\n\t- Thomas Davidson is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at Rutgers University.
