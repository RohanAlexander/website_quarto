We meet for an hour each week and are interested in anything that is data-focused across academia and industry. Typically, Fridays at noon (Toronto time) via Zoom, with most talks recorded and shared. All welcome. Free. Sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8).\n\nThe Toronto Data Workshop (TDW) brings together academia and industry to consider, collate, share, and disseminate best practices in doing data science, especially in the data-centric steps of a data science project: collection; cleaning; storage; retrieval; dissemination; protection; and communication. We meet weekly for an hour and aim to have a roughly even split of participants from academia and industry over the course of each term. For an invitation please sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sXbEixoa1iJR4Q7A8). Anyone is welcome to attend - you don't need to be affiliated with the university. \n\nCurrent organizing committee: \n\n- [Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/), \n- [Michaela Drouillard](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/michaela-drouillard-b29172164),\n- Rohan Alexander. \n\nPast committee members: \n\n- Amy Farrow (2021-22)\n- Faria Khandaker (2020-21)\n- Lorena Almaraz De La Garza (2021-22)\n\nThe TDW is a joint initiative between the Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto and we especially thank Dean Wendy Duff and Chair Radu Craiu for their support.\n\n# Fall 2023\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/tdw_100.png){width=33%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n*Coming soon*\n\n\n\n\n# Past talks\n\n## Fall 2022\n\n| Date | Speaker |  Recording |\n| ------- | ---------------  | ----- |\n| Fri 9 Sep 2022, noon - 1pm | Ryan Briggs, *University of Guelph* | https://youtu.be/dyLtxZM89iE |\n| Thu 22 Sep 2022, 5pm - 6pm | Melina Vidoni, *Australian National University* | - |\n| Fri 30 Sep 2022, 1pm - 2pm | Emily Giambalvo and Ence Morse, *The Washington Post* | - |\n| Fri 7 Oct 2022, noon - 1pm | Rohan Alexander, University of Toronto | https://youtu.be/omvXLYpcKEY |\n| Fri 14 Oct 2022, noon - 1pm | April Wang, *University of Michigan* | https://youtu.be/SD1Ofp0F5is |\n| Fri 21 Oct 2022, noon - 1pm | Meg Risdal, *Kaggle (Google)* | - |\n| Fri 4 Nov 2022, noon - 1pm | Meggie Debnath and Maitreyee Sidhaye, *St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto* | https://youtu.be/ltA_vOwrIWc |\n| Fri 18 Nov 2022, noon - 1pm | Lindsay Katz, *University of Toronto* | https://youtu.be/lYOdCNJOusg |\n| Fri 25 Nov 2022, noon - 1pm | Marcel Fortin and Leanne Trimble *U of T Map & Data Library* | https://youtu.be/_Ec40JPOxcA |\n| Fri 16 Dec 2022, noon - 1pm | Zane Schwartz, *Investigative Journalism Foundation* | |\n\n\n\n* Friday 9 September 2022, noon - 1pm\t\n\t**Ryan Briggs**, University of Guelph    \n\t*Statistical power in political science*    \n\t[Ryan Briggs](www.ryancbriggs.net) is a social scientist at the University of Guelph\n* Thursday 22 September 2022, 5pm - 6pm  \n  **Melina Vidoni**, Australian National University    \n\t[Dr Vidoni](https://melvidoni.rbind.io) is a Lecturer at the Australian National University in the CECS School of Computing, where she continues her domestic and international collaborations with Canada and Germany.
