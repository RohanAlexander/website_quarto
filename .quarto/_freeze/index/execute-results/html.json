I am particularly interested in the role of testing in data science.\n\nMy teaching helps students from a wide range of backgrounds learn how to use data to tell convincing stories. I am an associate editor of the *Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education*.\n\nI hold a PhD in Economics from the Australian National University where I focused on economic history and was supervised by [John Tang](https://sites.google.com/view/john-tang/home) (chair), [Martine Mariotti](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/mariotti-m), [Tim Hatton](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/hatton-tj), and [Zach Ward](https://sites.google.com/site/zachaward/).\n\n\nI am married to [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com), and we have two young children.\n",
