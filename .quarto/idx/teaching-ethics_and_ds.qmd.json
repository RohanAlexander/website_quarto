The purpose of this course is to develop students who can:\n\n- engage in thoughtful, ethical, critique of data science, its antecedents, current state, and likely evolution; and \n- work productively to implement existing data science methods, as well as contribute to the creation of novel methods or applications.\n\nEach week students will read relevant papers and books, engage with them through discussion with each other and the instructor, learn related technical skills, and bring this together through on-going assessment. All students are expected to be prepared for each week's discussion through completing the readings and technical requirements. A specific student will act as the lead for each week.\n\nThe course outline is available [here](pdfs/2021-ethics_and_data_science.pdf). \n\n### FAQ\n\n- Can I audit this course? Sure, but the concept of auditing doesn't make sense for this course. There are no lectures, we have weekly discussions. You're welcome to come along to the discussions if you'd like but please do the readings first.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to the following who helped develop this course: A Mahfouz, Assel Kushkeyeva, Irene Duah-Kessie, Ke-li Chiu, Paul Hodgetts, and Thomas Rosenthal.\n\n\n\n## Content\n\n### Week 1 - General\n<!-- *Brian Cantwell Smith, Reid Hoffman Professor of Artificial Intelligence and the Human, University of Toronto, will be invited to join the discussion briefly this week.* -->\n\n#### Ethical\n\nCore:\n\n- Cantwell Smith, Brian, 2019, *The Promise of AI*, MIT Press, Chapters 10-12.\n- Healy, Kieran, 2020, 'The Kitchen Counter Observatory', 21 May, https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/05/21/the-kitchen-counter-observatory/. \n- Keyes, Os, 2019, 'Counting the Countless', *Real Life*, 8 April, https://reallifemag.com/counting-the-countless/. \n- O'Neil, Cathy, 2016, *Weapons of Math Destruction*, Crown Books, Chapters 1, 3, and 4.\n\nAdditional (pick two):\n\n- Green, Ben, 2018, 'Data Science as Political Action: Grounding Data Science in a Politics of Justice', *arXiv*, 1811.03435, https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03435.\n- Irving, Geoffrey, and Amanda Askell, 2019, 'AI Safety Needs Social Scientists', *Distill*, 19 February, https://distill.pub/2019/safety-needs-social-scientists/. \n- Leslie, David, 2020, 'Tackling COVID-19 through Responsible AI Innovation: Five Steps in the Right Direction', *Harvard Data Science Review*, 5 June, https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/as1p81um.\n- Suresh, Harini, and John V.

These two aspects should be related to each other. You must submit all four, but only your best three blog posts will count, that is each blog post will account for 10 per cent of your overall mark.\n\nFor the first aspect (ethical), you are expected to write a moderate length discussion (think a paper of about two to three pages), of a reading, or set of readings, that we have covered over the past two weeks. Strong submissions will not limit themselves to reviewing a reading but will draw in larger issues and detail their own point of view. \n\nFor the second aspect (technical), you are expected to implement some small related technical aspect of what we have covered in the past two weeks. For instance, if we covered natural language processing then you may critically review a paper, and put together a chat bot. \n\nTo be clear, these two aspects should be related, tied together, and should be in the one blog post.\n\nYou should submit your blog post by emailing me a link to the relevant blog post on your website.\n\nThe proposed specific list of deadlines is: \n\n- Blog post 1: midnight, Sunday 24 January, 2021.\n- Blog post 2: midnight, Sunday 7 February, 2021.\n- Blog post 3: midnight, Sunday 7 March, 2021.\n- Blog post 4: midnight, Sunday 21 March, 2021.\n\nIn Week 1 we will discuss how these dates fit in with your other commitments and finalise  them at that point.\n\nThe instructor will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline.\n\n\n### Paper 1 (30 per cent)\n\n#### Task\nPlease gather and clean data on UofT salaries from the Sunshine List. Then conduct a Bayesian statistical analysis of your dataset to discuss the extent to which gender has an effect on salary. Finally please prepare a paper of around 10 pages that discusses your analysis. (Hint: gender is not explicitly part of the Sunshine List, you will need to grapple with what to do.)\n\n#### Background\nYou should make appropriate use of appendices for additional and supporting material, and thoroughly reference your paper, but neither the appendices nor the reference list count toward your page limit. Your paper should have an appropriate title, author, date, abstract, and introduction. It should document and overview your dataset. It should clearly specify your model, and then discuss the results of your analysis and any weaknesses. Your analysis should be fully reproducible, with code and data hosted on a public GitHub repo. Additionally, you should include a thorough discussion of ethical considerations relevant to your analysis. This would likely take at least three pages, but you are welcome to write as much as is needed to make the points you would like to make. Likely the best way to do this is to include a brief overview of the ethical points that you would like to discuss, and then include the rest of the discussion in an appendix. I understand that Bayesian analysis may be new to you. I will assist you with putting together the model, but it is up to you to understand and interpret the output.\n\n#### Submission\nTo submit your paper you should email me a link to a public GitHub repo. That repo should contain your paper in PDF format and all supporting code and data. Please send this email by midnight, Sunday, 14 February, 2021. Please do not make any changes to the repo after this. I will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline.\n\n### Paper 2 (40 per cent)\n\n#### Task\nIn consultation with me, please identify an appropriate research question and data source that, like the requirement for Paper 1, combines both ethical and technical aspects. Please prepare a paper that represents your best attempt to answer this question and shows off your ability to engage in thoughtful, ethical, critique. The paper should be as long as necessary, although all extraneous material should be included in appendices. The expectation is that this paper should make an original contribution, that could be published in an academic journal.\n\n#### Background\nPlease see the background provided for Paper 1, as this applies for Paper 2 as well. \n\n#### Submission\nYou must send the email with the GitHub link to me by midnight, Sunday, 23 April, 2020. Please do not make any changes to the repo after this. I will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline. No extensions are possible because of deadlines for instructors to submit grades.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Preamble \n\n### Overview\n\nThis is a course focused on the intersection of ethics and data science. The purpose of this course is to develop students who can:\n\n- engage in thoughtful, ethical, critique of data science, its antecedents, current state, and likely evolution; and \n- work productively to implement existing data science methods, as well as contribute to the creation of novel methods or applications.\n\nEach week students will read relevant papers and books, engage with them through discussion with each other and the instructor, learn related technical skills, and bring this together through on-going assessment. All students are expected to be prepared for each week's discussion through completing the readings and technical requirements. A specific student will act as the lead for each week.\n\nThe course outline is available [here](pdfs/2021-ethics_and_data_science.pdf). \n\n### FAQ\n\n- Can I audit this course? Sure, but the concept of auditing doesn't make sense for this course. There are no lectures, we have weekly discussions. You're welcome to come along to the discussions if you'd like but please do the readings first.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to the following who helped develop this course: A Mahfouz, Assel Kushkeyeva, Irene Duah-Kessie, Ke-li Chiu, Paul Hodgetts, and Thomas Rosenthal.\n\n\n\n## Content\n\n### Week 1 - General\n<!-- *Brian Cantwell Smith, Reid Hoffman Professor of Artificial Intelligence and the Human, University of Toronto, will be invited to join the discussion briefly this week.* -->\n\n#### Ethical\n\nCore:\n\n- Cantwell Smith, Brian, 2019, *The Promise of AI*, MIT Press, Chapters 10-12.\n- Healy, Kieran, 2020, 'The Kitchen Counter Observatory', 21 May, https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/05/21/the-kitchen-counter-observatory/. \n- Keyes, Os, 2019, 'Counting the Countless', *Real Life*, 8 April, https://reallifemag.com/counting-the-countless/. \n- O'Neil, Cathy, 2016, *Weapons of Math Destruction*, Crown Books, Chapters 1, 3, and 4.\n\nAdditional (pick two):\n\n- Green, Ben, 2018, 'Data Science as Political Action: Grounding Data Science in a Politics of Justice', *arXiv*, 1811.03435, https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03435.\n- Irving, Geoffrey, and Amanda Askell, 2019, 'AI Safety Needs Social Scientists', *Distill*, 19 February, https://distill.pub/2019/safety-needs-social-scientists/. \n- Leslie, David, 2020, 'Tackling COVID-19 through Responsible AI Innovation: Five Steps in the Right Direction', *Harvard Data Science Review*, 5 June, https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/as1p81um.\n- Suresh, Harini, and John V.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/230538.230561.\n\n#### Technical\n- TBD based on student interest.\n\n\n\n## Assessment\n\n### Four ethical and technical blog posts (30 per cent)\n\nOver the course of the term, you are expected to submit four blog posts that each comprise two aspects: 1) ethical and 2) technical. These two aspects should be related to each other. You must submit all four, but only your best three blog posts will count, that is each blog post will account for 10 per cent of your overall mark.\n\nFor the first aspect (ethical), you are expected to write a moderate length discussion (think a paper of about two to three pages), of a reading, or set of readings, that we have covered over the past two weeks. Strong submissions will not limit themselves to reviewing a reading but will draw in larger issues and detail their own point of view. \n\nFor the second aspect (technical), you are expected to implement some small related technical aspect of what we have covered in the past two weeks. For instance, if we covered natural language processing then you may critically review a paper, and put together a chat bot. \n\nTo be clear, these two aspects should be related, tied together, and should be in the one blog post.\n\nYou should submit your blog post by emailing me a link to the relevant blog post on your website.\n\nThe proposed specific list of deadlines is: \n\n- Blog post 1: midnight, Sunday 24 January, 2021.\n- Blog post 2: midnight, Sunday 7 February, 2021.\n- Blog post 3: midnight, Sunday 7 March, 2021.\n- Blog post 4: midnight, Sunday 21 March, 2021.\n\nIn Week 1 we will discuss how these dates fit in with your other commitments and finalise  them at that point.\n\nThe instructor will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline.\n\n\n### Paper 1 (30 per cent)\n\n#### Task\nPlease gather and clean data on UofT salaries from the Sunshine List. Then conduct a Bayesian statistical analysis of your dataset to discuss the extent to which gender has an effect on salary. Finally please prepare a paper of around 10 pages that discusses your analysis. (Hint: gender is not explicitly part of the Sunshine List, you will need to grapple with what to do.)\n\n#### Background\nYou should make appropriate use of appendices for additional and supporting material, and thoroughly reference your paper, but neither the appendices nor the reference list count toward your page limit. Your paper should have an appropriate title, author, date, abstract, and introduction. It should document and overview your dataset. It should clearly specify your model, and then discuss the results of your analysis and any weaknesses. Your analysis should be fully reproducible, with code and data hosted on a public GitHub repo. Additionally, you should include a thorough discussion of ethical considerations relevant to your analysis. This would likely take at least three pages, but you are welcome to write as much as is needed to make the points you would like to make. Likely the best way to do this is to include a brief overview of the ethical points that you would like to discuss, and then include the rest of the discussion in an appendix. I understand that Bayesian analysis may be new to you. I will assist you with putting together the model, but it is up to you to understand and interpret the output.\n\n#### Submission\nTo submit your paper you should email me a link to a public GitHub repo. That repo should contain your paper in PDF format and all supporting code and data. Please send this email by midnight, Sunday, 14 February, 2021. Please do not make any changes to the repo after this. I will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline.\n\n### Paper 2 (40 per cent)\n\n#### Task\nIn consultation with me, please identify an appropriate research question and data source that, like the requirement for Paper 1, combines both ethical and technical aspects. Please prepare a paper that represents your best attempt to answer this question and shows off your ability to engage in thoughtful, ethical, critique. The paper should be as long as necessary, although all extraneous material should be included in appendices. The expectation is that this paper should make an original contribution, that could be published in an academic journal.\n\n#### Background\nPlease see the background provided for Paper 1, as this applies for Paper 2 as well. \n\n#### Submission\nYou must send the email with the GitHub link to me by midnight, Sunday, 23 April, 2020. Please do not make any changes to the repo after this. I will make the marking guide available at least a week before the submission deadline.
