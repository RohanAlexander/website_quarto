There's an easy answer, which I expect is relevant for many 'Trinnies', and that's to just to get an A+ in their class. But more generally, you should send an email that demonstrates that you've got:\n\n- an interest; and\n- some skills.\n\nFor instance, these days a lot of papers in the fields that I'm interested in need some type of R package to go alongside them, and it can be hard to find students who can do this. If a student emailed having made an R package, that would demonstrate a lot of interest and skills, and it would be clear how I could involve them. There's an enormous difference between a student who emails claiming to know R, and a student who emails a link to a GitHub repo that demonstrates it.\n\n\n\n\n## Concluding remarks\n\nThank you very much to Manmeet for the invitation to be on this panel. It's a great honour to be here, alongside my colleagues - Sam, Emma, and Morris - and one of my bosses - Helen! Very much looking forward to the discussion.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)\n```\n\nThe slides are [here](https://rohanalexander.com/pdfs/trinity_college_remarks.pdf). \n\n## Introduction\n\nHi, my name is Rohan Alexander.
