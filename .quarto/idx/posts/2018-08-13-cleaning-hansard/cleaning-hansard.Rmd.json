If you just want short, specific, sections then the situation is fine - for pre-1981 go to Tim Sherratt's brilliant Historic Hansard website (http://historichansard.net); for 1981 to 2006 just use the parliament's website; and for 2006 onward just use Open Australia.

Making this nice corpus has been keeping me busy, and will be the subject of this series of posts.\n\nHelpfully, various people/organisations have gone to the Hansard website to get the XML files they provide and made them available as an easy download (note that these tend to have been posted as they were provided by the parliament, so they're full of typos, transcription errors, and a bunch of other mistakes):\n\n- 1901-1980 Hansard is available as XML from Tim Sherratt's Historic Hansard Github - https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml.\n- 1998-2014 Hansard is available from Andrew Turpin's website at University of Melbourne (https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/aturpin/qtCorpus/index.html).\n- 2006-current is available from Open Australia's website (http://data.openaustralia.org.au/origxml/).\n\nThese helpful people/organisations were able to get those dates (1901-1980 and 1998-current) because the Hansard provides the XML for those years on their website. The problem is the 1980s and the early/mid 1990s because they don't have the XML available on the website (and from emails with them - it seems as though they simply don't have it) - the only choice seems to be either to scrape it manually from the Hansard website or to grab all the PDFs, convert them, and then fix the mistakes.
