The Liberal/National Coalition won 76 seats which allowed it to form a majority government; while the Labor party won 69 seats to form the Opposition; the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team each won one seat; and there were two Independent members (Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan).\n\nVotes are cast at polling places in each division. In general voters can go to any polling place within their registered division, but some polling places that are close to a boundary will allow voting from there and some major polling places (such as the city hall of a state capital) will allow voting in any division. \n\nAlthough there are some exceptions divisions are generally constructed so that they each have roughly the same number of people. However this is not the case for polling places -- some are much larger than others. Nonetheless it is interesting to see the geographic distribution of which party received the most first-preference votes in each polling place, especially in the context of which party won the division.\n\n\n# Polling place data\nThe main packages for the data manipulation are the tidyverse and magrittr. leaflet allows the creation of interactive maps, ggmap creates static maps, and rgdal assists with dealing with geographic data. rmapshaper is used to reduce the size of the shapefile of division boundaries so that it is faster to load.\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(ggmap)\nlibrary(rgdal)\nlibrary(rmapshaper)\n```\n\nThe polling place results can be downloaded by state from the AEC website at http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-20499-Csv.htm. There the AEC also makes available a dataset that contains geocodes for each of the polling places. The separate datasets for each state need to be merged, and then each polling place needs to be geocoded. Finally some minor changes are needed to make the party names easier to follow.\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}\n#### Read in the polling place datasets (are state specific), and the geocodes for each polling place. Then put it all together to have one geocoded polling place dataset for all of Australia: Australia_booths. Finally, create a dataset that is filtered so that it just shows the winner of each booth: Australia_booths_winner. ####\n# Data importing\ngeocodes <- read_csv(\"data/GeneralPollingPlacesDownload-20499.csv\", skip = 1)\nNSW_booths <- read_csv(\"data/HouseStateFirstPrefsByPollingPlaceDownload-20499-NSW.csv\", skip = 1)\nQLD_booths <- read_csv(\"data/HouseStateFirstPrefsByPollingPlaceDownload-20499-QLD.csv\", skip = 1)\nVIC_booths <- read_csv(\"data/HouseStateFirstPrefsByPollingPlaceDownload-20499-VIC.csv\", skip = 1)\nACT_booths <- read_csv(\"data/HouseStateFirstPrefsByPollingPlaceDownload-20499-ACT.csv\", skip = 1)\nTAS_booths <- read_csv(\"data/HouseStateFirstPrefsByPollingPlaceDownload-20499-TAS.csv\", skip = 1)\nSA_booths <- read_csv(\"data/HouseStateFirstPrefsByPollingPlaceDownload-20499-SA.csv\", skip = 1)\nWA_booths <- read_csv(\"data/HouseStateFirstPrefsByPollingPlaceDownload-20499-WA.csv\", skip = 1)\nNT_booths <- read_csv(\"data/HouseStateFirstPrefsByPollingPlaceDownload-20499-NT.csv\", skip = 1)\n# Merge\nAustralia_booths <- rbind(NSW_booths, QLD_booths, VIC_booths, ACT_booths, TAS_booths, SA_booths, WA_booths, NT_booths)\n# Add the geocodes\nAustralia_booths <- Australia_booths %>% \n  left_join(geocodes)\n# Clean up\nrm(NSW_booths, QLD_booths, VIC_booths, ACT_booths, TAS_booths, SA_booths, WA_booths, NT_booths)\n# If you need it use this to get a list of the parties, ordered by the number of first-preference votes\n# first_votes <- Australia_booths %>%\n#   group_by(PartyNm) %>%\n#   summarise(votes = sum(OrdinaryVotes, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n#   arrange(desc(votes))\n# Combine some parties that are separate, but equivalent: Australian Labor Party & Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory) Branch & Labor, Country Liberals (NT) & Liberal, The Greens & The Greens (WA).\nAustralia_booths$PartyNm <- recode(Australia_booths$PartyNm, \"Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory) Branch\" = \"Australian Labor Party\", \"Labor\" = \"Australian Labor Party\")\nAustralia_booths$PartyNm <- recode(Australia_booths$PartyNm, \"Country Liberals (NT)\" = \"Liberal/LNP\", \"Liberal National Party of Queensland\" = \"Liberal/LNP\", \"Liberal\" = \"Liberal/LNP\")\nAustralia_booths$PartyNm <- recode(Australia_booths$PartyNm, \"The Greens (WA)\" = \"The Greens\")\n# Create an indicator for who won the polling place then filter on that\nAustralia_booths_winner <- Australia_booths %>% \n  group_by(PollingPlaceID) %>% \n  mutate(polling_place_winner = ifelse(max(OrdinaryVotes) == OrdinaryVotes, max(OrdinaryVotes), 0)) %>%\n  filter(polling_place_winner >= 1)\n#table(Australia_booths_winner$PartyNm)\n# There are three parties that only win one booth, so combine all those into 'Other'\nAustralia_booths_winner$PartyNm <- recode(Australia_booths_winner$PartyNm, \"Australian Recreational Fishers Party\" = \"Other\", \"Christian Democratic Party (Fred Nile Group)\" = \"Other\", \"Derryn Hinch's Justice Party\" = \"Other\")\n```\n\n# Division data\nThe divisions can be coloured based on which party won overall.
