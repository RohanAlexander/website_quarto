We have a perfect model of the world---it is the world! But it is too complicated. Because of this we must simplify the world in order for it to become data. In this course we explore how we do this, and the implications.\n\n### FAQ\n\n- Can I audit this course? Sure, but it is pointless, because the only way to learn this stuff is to do the work.\n- What is a tutorial? You write a paper. Then you send it to your tutor. The next day you have a meeting, 'tutorial', where you discuss it with them.\n- Why is there so much assessment? The only way to learn this stuff is to actually do the work, and students only do the work when they are assessed. It is unfortunate, but there is no way around it.\n- How difficult is the course? The course is not difficult, but the hands-on-projects mean it is a lot of work. \n- What is the format of the class? There are rarely old-school lectures because those are not effective. You should read the relevant chapter before class. During class we will focus on tutorials and discussion. We will also have industry guests discuss their experience.\n\n### Past iterations\n\n- 2023\n  - [Syllabus](pdfs/inf312-2023-syllabus.pdf)\n  - [Student evals](pdfs/inf312-2023-syllabus.pdf)\n- 2022\n  - [Syllabus](pdfs/inf312-2022-syllabus.pdf)\n  - [Student evals](pdfs/inf312-2022-evals.pdf)\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\n- None.\n\n### Textbook\n\n[Telling Stories with Data](https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com)\n\n## Content\n\n### Week 1\n\n- [Drinking from a fire hose](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/02-drinking_from_a_fire_hose.html)\n\n### Week 2\n\n- [Reproducible workflows](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/03-workflow.html)\n\n### Week 3\n\n- [R essentials](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/20-r_essentials.html)\n\n### Week 4\n\n- [Writing research](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/04-writing_research.html)\n\n### Week 5\n\n- [Static communication](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/05-static_communication.html)\n\n### Week 6\n\n- [Farm data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/06-farm.html)\n\n### Week 7\n\n- [Gather data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/07-gather.html)\n\n### Week 8\n\n- [Hunt data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/08-hunt.html)\n\n### Week 9\n\n- [Clean and prepare](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/09-clean_and_prepare.html)\n\n### Week 10\n\n- [Store and share](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/10-store_and_share.html)\n\n### Week 11\n\n- [Exploratory data analysis](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/11-eda.html)\n\n### Week 12\n\n- [Linear models](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/12-ijalm.html)\n\n## Assessment\n\n### Summary\n\n| Item \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| Weight (%) | Due date |\n| -------- | -----:| -----:|\n| Quiz \t\t\t\t\t\t| 8 \t\t | Weekly, end of each week |\n| Personal website\t\t\t| 1 \t\t | Friday, noon, Week 11 |\n| SQL quiz \t\t\t\t\t\t| 1 \t\t | Friday, noon, Week 11 |\n| Tutorial \t\t\t\t\t\t| 10 \t\t | Weekly, end of each week |\n| Paper 1 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 25 \t\t | Friday, noon, Week 3 |\n| Paper 2 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 25 \t\t | Friday, noon, Week 6 |\n| Paper 3 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 25 \t\t | Friday, noon, Week 8 |\n| Paper 4 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t| 25 \t\t | Friday, noon, Week 10 |\n| Final Paper (initial submission)  | 2 \t\t | Wednesday, noon, Week 12 |\n| Conduct peer review \t\t| 3 \t\t | Friday, noon, Week 12 |\n| Final Paper \t\t\t\t\t\t| 25 \t\t | Two weeks after that |\n\n**You must submit Paper 1.

The general expectation (although this differs from week to week) is about two pages of written content, which the tutor will read, discuss with you, and then provide a mark.

You are welcome to take breaks to feed your infant or express milk as needed, either in the classroom or elsewhere including [here](https://familycare.utoronto.ca/childcare/breastfeeding-at-u-of-t/). A list of baby change stations is also available [here](https://familycare.utoronto.ca/childcare/baby-change-stations-at-u-of-t/). Please communicate with me so that I can make sure that we have regular breaks to accommodate this. \n\nFor older children, I understand that unexpected disruptions in childcare can happen. You are welcome to bring your child to class in order to cover unforeseeable gaps in childcare.\n\n### Accommodations with regard to assessment\n\nPlease do **not** reveal your personal or medical information to me. I understand that illness or personal emergencies can happen from time to time. The following accommodations to assessment requirements exist to provide for those situations. \n\nStraight-forward (will automatically apply to all students - there's no need to ask for these):\n\n- Quiz: Only best five quizzes count.\n- Tutorial: Only best three tutorials count.\n- Papers #1-#4: Worst two are dropped.\n\nSo for those (with the exception of Paper #1), if you have a situation, then just don't submit.\n\nSlightly more involved: \n\n- Paper #1: You must submit something for Paper #1, even if it gets zero. If you have a medical reason that makes it impossible for you to submit Paper #1, then you are welcome to continue with the class, but then one of the remaining term papers (Papers #2 - #4), must be done individually to ensure fairness with the rest of the class.\n- Peer review: No accommodation or late submission is possible for this because it would hold up the rest of the class. If you cannot submit then email me before the deadline and the weight will be shifted to the final paper.\n- Final paper: The final paper is a critical piece of assessment. It is also up against deadlines for submission of grades. Extensions for valid reasons may be granted for a maximum of three days, however this isn't possible for all students (i.e. there are restrictions around graduating students). This means the exact extension needs to be at my discretion. To be considered, an extension request must be sent to rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca by the business day before the due date so there is time to get advice from a faculty/department/college advisor about your particular circumstance.\n\n### Re-grading\n\nRequests to have your work re-graded will not be accepted within 24 hours of the release of grades. This is to give you a chance to reflect. Similarly, requests to have your work re-graded more than seven days after the release of the grades will not be accepted. This is to ensure the course runs smoothly.\n\nInside that 1-7 day period if you would like to request a re-grade, please email rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca. Please specify where the marking error was made in relation to the marking guide. The entire assessment will be re-marked and it is possible that your grade could reduce.\n\nPlenty of students get 0 on the first paper, but go on to get an A+ overall in the course. The nature of the work in this course requires students to adjust from what is expected in other courses, and the forgiving assessment weighting is designed to allow this.\n\n### Plagiarism and integrity\n\nPlease do not plagiarize. In particular, be careful to acknowledge the source of code - if it is extensive then through proper citation and if it is just a couple of lines from Stack Overflow then in a comment immediately next to the code.\n\nYou are responsible for knowing the content of the University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. \n\nAcademic offenses includes (but is not limited to) plagiarism, cheating, copying R code, communication/extra resources during closed book assessments, purchasing labor for assessments (of any kind). Academic offenses will be taken seriously and dealt with accordingly. If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please contact me.\n\nPlease consult the University's [site](http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/) on Academic Integrity. Please also see the definition of plagiarism in section B.I.1.(d) of the University's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters available [here](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppjun011995.pdf). Please read the Code. Please review Cite it Right and if you require further clarification, consult the site [How Not to Plagiarize](http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/how-not-to-plagiarize.pdf). \n\n### Late policy\n\nYou are expected to manage your time effectively. If no extension has been granted and no accommodation applies, then the late submission of an assessment item carries a penalty of 10 percentage points per day to a maximum of one week after which it will no longer be accepted, e.g. a problem set submitted a day late that would have otherwise received 8/10 will receive 7/10, if that same problem set was submitted two days late then it would receive 6/10. \n\n### Writing\n\nPapers and reports should be well-written, well-organized, and easy to follow. They should flow easily from one point to the next. They should have proper sentence structure, spelling, vocabulary, and grammar. Each point should be articulated clearly and completely without being overly verbose. Papers should demonstrate your understanding of the topics you are studying in the course and your confidence in using the terms, techniques and issues you have learned. As always, references must be properly included and cited. If you have concerns about your ability to do any of this then please make use of the writing support provided to the faculty, colleges and the SGS Graduate Centre for Academic Communication. \n\n### Minimum submission requirement\n\nIf you are going to not be able to submit at least two term papers, and/or be unable to submit the final paper then it would be unfair on the other students to allow you to pass the course. Please ensure you and your college registrar or faculty/department advisor get in touch with me as early as possible if this may be the case for you.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Preamble \n\n### Overview\n\nTo a certain extent we are wasting our time.

If no extension has been granted and no accommodation applies, then the late submission of an assessment item carries a penalty of 10 percentage points per day to a maximum of one week after which it will no longer be accepted, e.g. a problem set submitted a day late that would have otherwise received 8/10 will receive 7/10, if that same problem set was submitted two days late then it would receive 6/10. \n\n### Writing\n\nPapers and reports should be well-written, well-organized, and easy to follow. They should flow easily from one point to the next. They should have proper sentence structure, spelling, vocabulary, and grammar. Each point should be articulated clearly and completely without being overly verbose. Papers should demonstrate your understanding of the topics you are studying in the course and your confidence in using the terms, techniques and issues you have learned. As always, references must be properly included and cited. If you have concerns about your ability to do any of this then please make use of the writing support provided to the faculty, colleges and the SGS Graduate Centre for Academic Communication. \n\n### Minimum submission requirement\n\nIf you are going to not be able to submit at least two term papers, and/or be unable to submit the final paper then it would be unfair on the other students to allow you to pass the course. Please ensure you and your college registrar or faculty/department advisor get in touch with me as early as possible if this may be the case for you.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"teaching-inf312.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
