## Preamble 

### Overview

Provides a crash-course in modeling for PhD students.

### Pre-requisites

- Data science foundations, or equivalent coverage of Chapters 1-13 of [Telling Stories with Data](https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com).

### Textbooks

- *Statistical Rethinking* - print copy needs to be purchased at about $70, (but McElreath provides free lectures).
- *Bayes Rules!* - print copy can be purchased, but there's a free version online.

### Acknowledgements

This course is largely Andrew Heiss' 'Bayesian Statistics' [course](https://bayesf22.classes.andrewheiss.com), with changed assessment, and I am grateful for his ideas and suggestions.
