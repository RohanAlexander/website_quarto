title: "Conference on statistical software"
---

Statistical software is an increasingly important aspect of the work of statisticians and data scientists.

CANSSI Ontario and the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto (U of T), are excited to host the CANSSI Ontario Statistical Software Conference. This is a one-day conference bringing together academic and industry participants to share best practices on developing statistical software, exchange ideas for what is needed, and show off their latest software advances.
