I am an assistant professor at the University of Toronto, jointly appointed in the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/profile/rohan-alexander/) and the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/rohan-alexander). I am interested in developing workflows that improve the trustworthiness of data science. I am particularly interested in the role of code and testing in data science.

I am the Assistant Director of [CANSSI Ontario](https://canssiontario.utoronto.ca); the Director, Technical Skills Curriculum & Instruction, for the Data Sciences Institute's [Data Science and Machine Learning Certificates](https://github.com/UofT-DSI); a Senior Fellow at [Massey College](https://www.masseycollege.ca); a faculty affiliate at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://sr-institute.utoronto.ca/); and a co-lead of the [DSI](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca) Thematic Program in Reproducibility.

My book, *[Telling Stories With Data](https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/)*, argues that a trustworthiness revolution is needed in data science, and I propose a view of what it could look like. It has been strongly endorsed, including: Andrew Gelman *"I absolutely love this book"*, Kosuke Imai *"I highly recommend this unique book!"*, Sir David Spiegelhalter *"[A]n extraordinary, wonderful, book..."*, Daniela Witten *"An excellent book"*, and Richard McElreath *"This is not another statistics book. It is much better than that."* You can buy a print copy [here](https://www.routledge.com/Telling-Stories-with-Data-With-Applications-in-R/Alexander/p/book/9781032134772) and you can access the free online version [here](https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/).

My teaching helps students from a wide range of backgrounds learn how to use data to tell convincing stories. I am an associate editor of the *Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education*.

I hold a PhD in Economics from the Australian National University where I focused on economic history and was supervised by [John Tang](https://sites.google.com/view/john-tang/home) (chair), [Martine Mariotti](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/mariotti-m), [Tim Hatton](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/hatton-tj), and [Zach Ward](https://sites.google.com/site/zachaward/).

I am married to [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com), and we have two young children.
